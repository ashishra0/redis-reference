### What is Redis

* Redis is an open source, in memory data-structure store, used as a database,cache, message broker.
* NoSQL key-value store.
* Redis and MongoDB are similar in NoSQL structure.
* MongoDB is a disk-based document store, while redis is memory based.
* Redis is used for caching.
* Redis and Memcache are similar because both are in memory data store.
* Memcache is volatile, the data is lost upon restart because there is no persistance.
* Data is not lost in Redis because, redis has in-built persistance.
